## General Information

This is a Telegram bot that gives you random pic of a dressed pet to boost your serotonin level. Pics are taken from MySQL DB. Made to my improve Python skills and brighten someone's day :)

Written completely in Python. I've also used one SQL SELECT statement to get random pic from MySQL DB.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.10.4
